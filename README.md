# Eagle English

This project is a prototype landing page for an English School where you can find some basic information about the course and a little about the teachers.

This project was designed to test some of the abilities I learned in the first module of the Microverse program. I had to create a website from scratch following basic [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015). 

<br>
<details>
  <summary>The abilities to be tested:  </summary>
  
- Use semantic HTML tags.
- Apply best practices in HTML code.
- Use CSS selectors correctly.
- Use CSS box model.
- Use Flexbox to place elements in the page.
- Demonstrate ability to create UIs adaptable to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Use GitHub Pages to deploy web pages.
- Apply JavaScript best practices and language style guides in code.
- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.
- Use objects to store and access data.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.

  <summary>Requirements for this projects:  </summary>

* Build only these 2 pages: The "home" page and the "about" page.

* Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes: mobile: up to 768px wide and desktop: 768px or wider.

* Interactions
    - Links:
      - The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
      - The logo in the header links to the home page.
      
    - Mobile menu
      - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
      - There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
      - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.

*Dynamic page
  - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
  - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
